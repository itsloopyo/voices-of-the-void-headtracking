//
// The code is identical to still-wakes-the-deep-headtracking's and
// high-on-life-headtracking's camera_boundary.cpp, which sit behind the same
// GetPlayerViewPoint hook on the same engine family. It is a port rather than a
// re-derivation because signs are settled in a running game, not by geometry.

// the world up-axis and the horizon stays level on a pitched turn. False
// post-multiplies a camera-local quaternion, which leans the horizon instead.
