# Ultimate ASI Loader (vendored)

Bundled copy of Ultimate ASI Loader, the install-time source of truth.

`dinput8.dll` is extracted from the upstream asset untouched. install.cmd copies it to
`winmm.dll` beside the game exe (`VotV/Binaries/Win64/`) as the ASI hook slot:
`VotV-Win64-Shipping.exe` imports WINMM.dll statically and does not import
dinput8.dll, which Windows would only resolve out of System32.
